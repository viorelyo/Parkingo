## Goals
Develop a system for real time parking lots detection.

## Idea
Living in a big city, it's a common problem to find available parking spaces for your car. People spend on average **7.8 minutes** searching for a parking space. That's a waste of your time and can also cause traffic congestion. Having a real time parking space detection system based on images provided by CCTVs could considerably improve the parking experience at a relatively low cost.
