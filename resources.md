- [x] Summarize Related Works
- [x] Useful tools
- [x] Documentation  
- [x] App flow  
  
- **Lab3+4** 
- [x] Choose algorithms (custom_bullshit / VGG16)
- [x] Decide whether to detect also the parking spots (Nope)
- [x] Calculate computing time (HOWLY SHIT - TOO LONG!!!!)
- [x] Adapt following repos:  (Hehe - PARQ)
1. https://github.com/gstark0/Parq
2. https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/Unsupervised-Parking-Lot-Detection#introduction
3. https://github.com/jaymaity/CarDetectionInParkinglot
4. https://github.com/ankit1khare/Smart-Park-with-YOLO-V3

- **Lab5**
- [x] Adapt VGG16 algorithm to be used in the app `[RAUL]`
- [x] Code refactor `[OLGA]`
- [x] Flask server `[VIOREL]`
- [x] Auto video loading on webpage access `[VIOREL]`
- [ ] Make the webpage asynchronous `[Mr.X]`
- [ ] Find live static CCTV from Parking Lot on YOUTUBE `[TEAM]`
- [ ] Create labels for each parking spot bounding as CSV Format `[OLGA]`
- [ ] Test if algorithm(s) classify spots from frames of that video `[OLGA]`
- [ ] Calculate time(TIME_X) spent by each algorithm to classify an entire frame `[Mr.X]`
- [ ] Capture each frame after TIME_X seconds from playing LIVE video `[RAUL]`
- [ ] Create a hover layer above LIVE video to mark the available clicked spot `[RAUL]`
- [ ] Generate a dynamic table (or smth. else to interact with the user) to show free/occupied spots (onClick on a free spot - the layer with marked spot should hover LIVE video)  `[Mr.X]`
- [ ] UI/UX `[TEAM]`
- [ ] QA `[Benta]`
- [ ] WIKI/Ontology/Mindmap `[TEAM]`
- [ ] App flow pipeline `[Mr.X]`
