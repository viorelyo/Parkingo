### Idea

Deep Learning approach - Applying Convolutional Neural Networks to classify occupancy of each parking spot.  
Keras model (with TensorFlow backend) was trained on `cnrpark.it` (patches) dataset.  
Predictions are made on images from 8th camera from `cnrpark.it`.

### Algorithms
1. Custom architecture 
2. VGG16 architecture with pretrained weights

### Application
Web application for viewing the occupancy of parking spots from a video with a `flask` server backend.
